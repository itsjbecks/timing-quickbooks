# Timing.app x Quickbooks

This is a simple app that will connect [Timing.app](https://timingapp.com) and Quickbooks Online to automate all the time tracking and invoicing :zap:

Currently, it does none of that. Instead it takes the export of a CSV and summarizes it by the day, grabs the total hours that I can copy and pasta into my invoice.
